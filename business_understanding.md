# üéØ Strategic & Stakeholder Analysis

## Overview of Strategic Alignment
CyberGuard Analytics‚Äô initiative to develop specialized anomaly detection models aligns directly with the company‚Äôs strategic vision of becoming the leader in proactive, predictive cybersecurity. The project supports three strategic pillars:

1. **Enhanced Client Value:** Reducing mean time to detect (MTTD) and false positives improves client security outcomes.
2. **Market Differentiation:** Custom, attack-specific detection models provide a competitive edge in an increasingly commoditized market.
3. **Sustainable Growth:** Creates intellectual property and scalable capabilities that extend CyberGuard‚Äôs product portfolio.

## Stakeholder Analysis
| Stakeholder | Role | Primary Interest |
|--------------|------|------------------|
| **Eleanor Vance (CEO)** | Executive Sponsor | Strategic alignment and market impact |
| **Alistair Finch (CFO)** | Financial Oversight | ROI, cost control, revenue growth |
| **Marcus Bellweather (Tactical Manager)** | Project Oversight | KPIs, progress tracking, operational coordination |
| **Anya Sharma (Business/Data Specialist)** | Data Quality & Governance | Data sourcing, integrity, and compliance |
| **David Chen (Security Specialist)** | Security & Compliance | Threat intelligence, ethical data use, regulatory adherence |
| **Isabella Rossi (Enterprise Architect)** | Systems Integration | Infrastructure alignment, scalability, technical feasibility |
| **Client SOC & IR Teams** | End Users | Model performance, operational usability |

## Data Requirements and Sources
Primary data source: **NETWORK_TRAFFIC_HISTORY** database on AWS.

Contains:
- Flow records (IPs, ports, protocols, byte counts)
- Client metadata (network configurations)
- Historical attack labels

Requirements:
- High completeness and accuracy
- Standardization across clients
- Low latency (real-time ingestion)
- Explicit client consent and compliance with data usage agreements

## Technical Feasibility
Feasible but challenging.  
Existing AWS infrastructure (SageMaker, Lambda, Kinesis, CloudWatch) supports scalability and deployment. Containerization (Docker/Kubernetes) will streamline development and consistency. Challenges include real-time data throughput, integration across diverse client systems, and managing large data volumes.

## Economic Feasibility (ROI Analysis)
- **Total Estimated Cost:** $1.2 million
- **Projected Incremental Revenue:** $3.5 million over 3 years
- **Cost Savings:** $400,000 (efficiency gains)
- **Projected ROI:** 18‚Äì22% within 3 years

Assumes stable adoption rates and consistent model performance.

## Operational Feasibility
Operational integration achievable through:
- Containerized deployment with automated CI/CD
- Monitoring dashboards and alerting systems
- Training and documentation for SOC teams

Challenges include upskilling staff and managing data drift over time.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations
- Client consent mandatory for data use
- Adherence to data residency and retention laws
- Ethical use policies reviewed with Legal and Ethics departments
- Bias mitigation and model transparency required for accountability

## Data Availability and Quality Assessment
- **Gaps:** 5‚Äì10% missing entries, inconsistent client logging
- **Issues:** Format inconsistencies, time zone variance
- **Remediation:** Data cleaning, imputation, standardization, and feature engineering
- **Storage:** Secure AWS environment with RBAC

## Resource Availability and Constraints
- 4 Data Scientists, 1 Data Engineer, 1 Enterprise Architect, 1 Security Specialist, 1 Project Manager
- $500,000 base budget + $50,000 contingency
- Training budget of $50,000 for ML, AWS, and compliance upskilling
- Heavy dependence on AWS infrastructure

## Business Process Impact Analysis
- SOC teams will gain faster, more accurate alerts
- IR teams will experience reduced triage load
- Compliance and governance oversight to expand due to data sensitivity

## Workflow Changes Needed
- Integration of model outputs into SIEM and SOAR systems
- Establishment of feedback loop between Data Science and Operations
- Adoption of new CI/CD and retraining pipelines

## Training Requirements
- Advanced ML (deep/reinforcement learning)
- AWS cloud and deployment tools
- Cyber threat intelligence
- Data privacy and explainability
- SOC integration workflows
