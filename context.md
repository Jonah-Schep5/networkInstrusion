Phishing Detection

    Pattern: Deceptive web traffic and email-related connections
    Key Features: Connections to suspicious domains, specific payload patterns, timing correlation with email
    Example Signature: HTTP requests to newly registered domains with credential submission patterns
    Detection Approach: Domain reputation analysis and behavioral correlation
    Suggested Model Type: Classification model with domain features and timing analysis





Insider Threat Detection

    Pattern: Unusual behavior from internal users/systems
    Key Features: Off-hours access, unusual data access patterns, privilege escalation indicators
    Example Signature: Internal user accessing 10x normal data volume at 3 AM
    Detection Approach: Behavioral baseline deviation analysis
    Suggested Model Type: User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) with statistical profiling




Zero-Day Exploit Detection

    Pattern: Previously unseen attack patterns exploiting unknown vulnerabilities
    Key Features: Novel traffic patterns, exploitation of specific services, payload anomalies
    Example Signature: Unusual protocol behavior or unexpected service responses
    Detection Approach: Unsupervised learning to identify novel patterns
    Suggested Model Type: Deep autoencoders for detecting unprecedented patterns



Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Detection

    Pattern: Sophisticated, multi-stage attacks with low-and-slow approach
    Key Features: Subtle behavioral changes, long-term pattern evolution, multi-vector coordination
    Example Signature: Gradual increase in data access combined with new external connections over weeks
    Detection Approach: Long-term behavioral analysis and correlation across multiple indicators
    Suggested Model Type: Ensemble of temporal models with long-term memory (LSTM networks)
